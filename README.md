### Description

The purpose of this project was to create a dahsboard as a Data Analyst. To make this I wanted to try the framework [AstroJs](https://astro.build/)  and try to play with a football API.
I selected the top 10 fooball leagues and present multiple KPI's by season : 
 * Goals scored during season.
 * Yellow cards.
 * Red cards.
 * The total minutes cumulated played.
 * Top scorer of the season.
 * The season winner.
 * Match played.
 * Chart showing goals scored by club.
